# Community Management Features for the Gold Card Community
This repository contains projects that the Taiwan Gold Card Community
uses for Community Management.

The first project is 'gcjoin'. GCjoin is a form to allow sign-up to the community
that verifies someone's Gold Card holder status, and back-end features
to allow the community administrators to see the details for on-boarding activities.

gcjoin is written in Django4, with Python3
